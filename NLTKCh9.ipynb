Such features may be quite simple, such as extracting the last letter of a word, or more complex, such as a part-of-speech tag which has itself been predicted by the classifier. In this chapter, we will investigate the role of features in building rule-based grammars. In contrast to feature extractors, which record features that have been automatically detected, we are now going to declare the features of words and phrases. We start off with a very simple example, using dictionaries to store features and their values."

One possible approach to parsing productions containing feature constraints is to compile out all admissible values of the features in question so that we end up with a large, fully specified CFG along the lines of (8). By contrast, the parser process illustrated above works directly with the underspecified productions given by the grammar. Feature values \"flow upwards\" from lexical entries, and variable values are then associated with those values, via bindings (i.e., dictionaries) such as {?n: 'sg', ?t: 'pres'}. As the parser assembles information about the nodes of the tree it is building, these variable bindings are used to instantiate values in these nodes; thus the underspecified VP[NUM=?n, TENSE=?t] -> TV[NUM=?n, TENSE=?t] NP[] becomes instantiated as VP[NUM='sg', TENSE='pres'] -> TV[NUM='sg', TENSE='pres'] NP[] by looking up the values of ?n and ?t in the bindings.\n",

    "So far, we have only seen feature values like sg and pl. These simple values are usually called atomic — that is, they can't be decomposed into subparts. A special case of atomic values are boolean values, that is, values that just specify whether a property is true or false. For example, we might want to distinguish auxiliary verbs such as can, may, will and do with the boolean feature AUX. For example, the production V[TENSE=pres, aux=+] -> 'can' means that can receives the value pres for TENSE and + or true for AUX. There is a widely adopted convention which abbreviates the representation of boolean features f; instead of aux=+ or aux=-, we use +aux and -aux respectively. These are just abbreviations, however, and the parser interprets them as though + and - are like any other atomic value. (17) shows some representative productions:\n",

    "We have spoken of attaching \"feature annotations\" to syntactic categories. A more radical approach represents the whole category — that is, the non-terminal symbol plus the annotation — as a bundle of features. For example, N[NUM=sg] contains part of speech information which can be represented as POS=N. An alternative notation for this category therefore is [POS=N, NUM=sg].\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to atomic-valued features, features may take values that are themselves feature structures. For example, we can group together agreement features (e.g., person, number and gender) as a distinguished part of a category, grouped together as the value of AGR. In this case, we say that AGR has a complex value. (18) depicts the structure, in a format known as an attribute value matrix (AVM).\n",

    "In passing, we should point out that there are alternative approaches for displaying AVMs; 9.3 shows an example. Athough feature structures rendered in the style of (18) are less visually pleasing, we will stick with this format, since it corresponds to the output we will be getting from NLTK.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we return to feature based grammar and explore a variety of linguistic issues, and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating features into the grammar.\n",
    "Subcategorization\n",
    "\n",
    "In 8, we augmented our category labels to represent different kinds of verb, and used the labels IV and TV for intransitive and transitive verbs respectively. This allowed us to write productions like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* (29)\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "VP -> IV\n",
    "VP -> TV NP\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we know that IV and TV are two kinds of V, they are just atomic nonterminal symbols from a CFG, as distinct from each other as any other pair of symbols. This notation doesn't let us say anything about verbs in general, e.g. we cannot say \"All lexical items of category V can be marked for tense\", since walk, say, is an item of category IV, not V. So, can we replace category labels such as TV and IV by V along with a feature that tells us whether the verb combines with a following NP object or whether it can occur without any complement?\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple approach, originally developed for a grammar framework called Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG), tries to solve this problem by allowing lexical categories to bear a SUBCAT which tells us what subcategorization class the item belongs to. While GPSG used integer values for SUBCAT, the example below adopts more mnemonic values, namely intrans, trans and clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "(30)\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "VP[TENSE=?t, NUM=?n] -> V[SUBCAT=intrans, TENSE=?t, NUM=?n]\n",
    "VP[TENSE=?t, NUM=?n] -> V[SUBCAT=trans, TENSE=?t, NUM=?n] NP\n",
    "VP[TENSE=?t, NUM=?n] -> V[SUBCAT=clause, TENSE=?t, NUM=?n] SBar\n",
    "\n",
    "V[SUBCAT=intrans, TENSE=pres, NUM=sg] -> 'disappears' | 'walks'\n",
    "V[SUBCAT=trans, TENSE=pres, NUM=sg] -> 'sees' | 'likes'\n",
    "V[SUBCAT=clause, TENSE=pres, NUM=sg] -> 'says' | 'claims'\n",
    "\n",
    "V[SUBCAT=intrans, TENSE=pres, NUM=pl] -> 'disappear' | 'walk'\n",
    "V[SUBCAT=trans, TENSE=pres, NUM=pl] -> 'see' | 'like'\n",

    "V[SUBCAT=clause, TENSE=past, NUM=?n] -> 'said' | 'claimed'\n",
    "\n",
    "When we see a lexical category like V[SUBCAT=trans], we can interpret the SUBCAT specification as a pointer to a production in which V[SUBCAT=trans] is introduced as the head child in a VP production. By convention, there is a correspondence between the values of SUBCAT and the productions that introduce lexical heads. On this approach, SUBCAT can only appear on lexical categories; it makes no sense, for example, to specify a SUBCAT value on VP. As required, walk and like both belong to the category V. Nevertheless, walk will only occur in VPs expanded by a production with the feature SUBCAT=intrans on the right hand side, as opposed to like, which requires a SUBCAT=trans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our third class of verbs above, we have specified a category SBar. This is a label for subordinate clauses such as the complement of claim in the example You claim that you like children. We require two further productions to analyze such sentences:\n",

    "The resulting structure is the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "(32)\t\ttree_images/ch09-tree-10.png\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative treatment of subcategorization, due originally to a framework known as categorial grammar, is represented in feature based frameworks such as PATR and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Rather than using SUBCAT values as a way of indexing productions, the SUBCAT value directly encodes the valency of a head (the list of arguments that it can combine with). For example, a verb like put that takes NP and PP complements (put the book on the table) might be represented as (33):\n",
    "\n",
    "(33)\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "V[SUBCAT=<NP, NP, PP>]\n",
    "\n",
    "This says that the verb can combine with three arguments. The leftmost element in the list is the subject NP, while everything else — an NP followed by a PP in this case — comprises the subcategorized-for complements. When a verb like put is combined with appropriate complements, the requirements which are specified in the SUBCAT are discharged, and only a subject NP is needed. This category, which corresponds to what is traditionally thought of as VP, might be represented as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "(34)\t\t\n",
    "\n",
    "V[SUBCAT=<NP>]\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a sentence is a kind of verbal category that has no requirements for further arguments, and hence has a SUBCAT whose value is the empty list. The tree (35) shows how these category assignments combine in a parse of Kim put the book on the table."

    "### Heads Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted in the previous section that by factoring subcategorization information out of the main category label, we could express more generalizations about properties of verbs. Another property of this kind is the following: expressions of category V are heads of phrases of category VP. Similarly, Ns are heads of NPs, As (i.e., adjectives) are heads of APs, and Ps (i.e., prepositions) are heads of PPs. Not all phrases have heads — for example, it is standard to say that coordinate phrases (e.g., the book and the bell) lack heads — nevertheless, we would like our grammar formalism to express the parent / head-child relation where it holds. At present, V and VP are just atomic symbols, and we need to find a way to relate them using features (as we did earlier to relate IV and TV).\n",
    "\n",
    "X-bar Syntax addresses this issue by abstracting out the notion of phrasal level. It is usual to recognize three such levels. If N represents the lexical level, then N' represents the next level up, corresponding to the more traditional category Nom, while N'' represents the phrasal level, corresponding to the category NP. (36a) illustrates a representative structure while (36b) is the more conventional counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The head of the structure (36a) is N while N' and N'' are called (phrasal) projections of N. N'' is the maximal projection, and N is sometimes called the zero projection. One of the central claims of X-bar syntax is that all constituents share a structural similarity. Using X as a variable over N, V, A and P, we say that directly subcategorized complements of a lexical head X are always placed as siblings of the head, whereas adjuncts are placed as siblings of the intermediate category, X'. Thus, the configuration of the two P'' adjuncts in (37) contrasts with that of the complement P'' in (36a).\n",

One issue of considerable importance in theoretical linguistics has been the nature of the material that can intervene between a filler and the gap that it licenses; in particular, can we simply list a finite set of sequences that separate the two? The answer is No: there is no upper bound on the distance between filler and gap. This fact can be easily illustrated with constructions involving sentential complements, as shown in (52).\n",

This constellation of properties leads to the notion of an unbounded dependency construction; that is, a filler-gap dependency where there is no upper bound on the distance between filler and gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of mechanisms have been suggested for handling unbounded dependencies in formal grammars; here we illustrate the approach due to Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar that involves slash categories. A slash category has the form Y/XP; we interpret this as a phrase of category Y that is missing a sub-constituent of category XP. For example, S/NP is an S that is missing an NP. The use of slash categories is illustrated in (53).\n",
    "\n",
    "The top part of the tree introduces the filler who (treated as an expression of category NP[+wh]) together with a corresponding gap-containing constituent S/NP. The gap information is then \"percolated\" down the tree via the VP/NP category, until it reaches the category NP/NP. At this point, the dependency is discharged by realizing the gap information as the empty string, immediately dominated by NP/NP.\n",

    "Do we need to think of slash categories as a completely new kind of object? Fortunately, we can accommodate them within our existing feature based framework, by treating slash as a feature, and the category to its right as a value; that is, S/NP is reducible S[SLASH=NP]. In practice, this is also how the parser interprets slassh categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The traditional categories of context-free grammar are atomic symbols. An important motivation for feature structures is to capture fine-grained distinctions that would otherwise require a massive multiplication of atomic categories.\n",
    "* By using variables over feature values, we can express constraints in grammar productions that allow the realization of different feature specifications to be inter-dependent.\n",
    "* Typically we specify fixed values of features at the lexical level and constrain the values of features in phrases to unify with the corresponding values in their children.\n",
    "* Feature values are either atomic or complex. A particular sub-case of atomic value is the Boolean value, represented by convention as [+/- f].\n",
    "* Two features can share a value (either atomic or complex). Structures with shared values are said to be re-entrant. Shared values are represented by numerical indexes (or tags) in AVMs.\n",
    "* A path in a feature structure is a tuple of features corresponding to the labels on a sequence of arcs from the root of the graph representation.\n",
    "* Two paths are equivalent if they share a value.\n",
    "* Feature structures are partially ordered by subsumption. FS0 subsumes FS1 when FS0 is more general (less informative) than FS1.\n",
    "* The unification of two structures FS0 and FS1, if successful, is the feature structure FS2 that contains the combined information of both FS0 and FS1.\n",
    "* If unification specializes a path π in FS, then it also specializes every path π' equivalent to π.\n",
    "* We can use feature structures to build succinct analyses of a wide variety of linguistic phenomena, including verb subcategorization, inversion constructions, unbounded dependency constructions and case government."
