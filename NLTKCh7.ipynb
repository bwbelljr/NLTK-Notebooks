    "For any given question, it's likely that someone has written the answer down somewhere. The amount of natural language text that is available in electronic form is truly staggering, and is increasing every day. However, the complexity of natural language can make it very difficult to access the information in that text. The state of the art in NLP is still a long way from being able to build general-purpose representations of meaning from unrestricted text. If we instead focus our efforts on a limited set of questions or \"entity relations,\" such as \"where are different facilities located,\" or \"who is employed by what company,\" we can make significant progress. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\n",

    "As we can see, NP-chunks are often smaller pieces than complete noun phrases. For example, the market for system-management software for Digital's hardware is a single noun phrase (containing two nested noun phrases), but it is captured in NP-chunks by the simpler chunk the market. One of the motivations for this difference is that NP-chunks are defined so as not to contain other NP-chunks. Consequently, any prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses that modify a nominal will not be included in the corresponding NP-chunk, since they almost certainly contain further noun phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful sources of information for NP-chunking is part-of-speech tags. This is one of the motivations for performing part-of-speech tagging in our information extraction system. We demonstrate this approach using an example sentence that has been part-of-speech tagged in 2.2. In order to create an NP-chunker, we will first define a chunk grammar, consisting of rules that indicate how sentences should be chunked. In this case, we will define a simple grammar with a single regular-expression rule [2]. This rule says that an NP chunk should be formed whenever the chunker finds an optional determiner (DT) followed by any number of adjectives (JJ) and then a noun (NN). Using this grammar, we create a chunk parser [3], and test it on our example sentence [4]. The result is a tree, which we can either print [5], or display graphically [6].\n",

    "As befits their intermediate status between tagging and parsing (8), chunk structures can be represented using either tags or trees. The most widespread file representation uses IOB tags. In this scheme, each token is tagged with one of three special chunk tags, I (inside), O (outside), or B (begin). A token is tagged as B if it marks the beginning of a chunk. Subsequent tokens within the chunk are tagged I. All other tokens are tagged O. The B and I tags are suffixed with the chunk type, e.g. B-NP, I-NP. Of course, it is not necessary to specify a chunk type for tokens that appear outside a chunk, so these are just labeled O. An example of this scheme is shown in 7.6."

    "The goal of a named entity recognition (NER) system is to identify all textual mentions of the named entities. This can be broken down into two sub-tasks: identifying the boundaries of the NE, and identifying its type. While named entity recognition is frequently a prelude to identifying relations in Information Extraction, it can also contribute to other tasks. For example, in Question Answering (QA), we try to improve the precision of Information Retrieval by recovering not whole pages, but just those parts which contain an answer to the user's question. Most QA systems take the documents returned by standard Information Retrieval, and then attempt to isolate the minimal text snippet in the document containing the answer. Now suppose the question was Who was the first President of the US?, and one of the documents that was retrieved contained the following passage:\n",
    "\n",
    "(5)\t\tThe Washington Monument is the most prominent structure in Washington, D.C. and one of the city's early attractions. It was built in honor of George Washington, who led the country to independence and then became its first President.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the question leads us to expect that an answer should be of the form X was the first President of the US, where X is not only a noun phrase, but also refers to a named entity of type PER. This should allow us to ignore the first sentence in the passage. While it contains two occurrences of Washington, named entity recognition should tell us that neither of them has the correct type.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we go about identifying named entities? One option would be to look up each word in an appropriate list of names. For example, in the case of locations, we could use a gazetteer, or geographical dictionary, such as the Alexandria Gazetteer or the Getty Gazetteer. However, doing this blindly runs into problems, as shown in 7.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the gazetteer has good coverage of locations in many countries, and incorrectly finds locations like Sanchez in the Dominican Republic and On in Vietnam. Of course we could omit such locations from the gazetteer, but then we won't be able to identify them when they do appear in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets even harder in the case of names for people or organizations. Any list of such names will probably have poor coverage. New organizations come into existence every day, so if we are trying to deal with contemporary newswire or blog entries, it is unlikely that we will be able to recognize many of the entities using gazetteer lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major source of difficulty is caused by the fact that many named entity terms are ambiguous. Thus May and North are likely to be parts of named entities for DATE and LOCATION, respectively, but could both be part of a PERSON; conversely Christian Dior looks like a PERSON but is more likely to be of type ORGANIZATION. A term like Yankee will be ordinary modifier in some contexts, but will be marked as an entity of type ORGANIZATION in the phrase Yankee infielders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further challenges are posed by multi-word names like Stanford University, and by names that contain other names such as Cecil H. Green Library and Escondido Village Conference Service Center. In named entity recognition, therefore, we need to be able to identify the beginning and end of multi-token sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition is a task that is well-suited to the type of classifier-based approach that we saw for noun phrase chunking. In particular, we can build a tagger that labels each word in a sentence using the IOB format, where chunks are labeled by their appropriate type.

As indicated earlier, we will typically be looking for relations between specified types of named entity. One way of approaching this task is to initially look for all triples of the form (X, α, Y), where X and Y are named entities of the required types, and α is the string of words that intervenes between X and Y. We can then use regular expressions to pull out just those instances of α that express the relation that we are looking for. The following example searches for strings that contain the word in.
