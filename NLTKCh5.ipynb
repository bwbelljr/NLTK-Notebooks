    "Back in elementary school you learnt the difference between nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These \"word classes\" are not just the idle invention of grammarians, but are useful categories for many language processing tasks. As we will see, they arise from simple analysis of the distribution of words in text. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    What are lexical categories and how are they used in natural language processing?\n",
    "    What is a good Python data structure for storing words and their categories?\n",
    "    How can we automatically tag each word of a text with its word class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we'll cover some fundamental techniques in NLP, including sequence labeling, n-gram models, backoff, and evaluation. These techniques are useful in many areas, and tagging gives us a simple context in which to present them. We will also see how tagging is the second step in the typical NLP pipeline, following tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of classifying words into their parts of speech and labeling them accordingly is known as part-of-speech tagging, POS-tagging, or simply tagging. Parts of speech are also known as word classes or lexical categories. The collection of tags used for a particular task is known as a tagset. Our emphasis in this chapter is on exploiting tags, and tagging text automatically."

    "As we have seen, a tagged word of the form (word, tag) is an association between a word and a part-of-speech tag. Once we start doing part-of-speech tagging, we will be creating programs that assign a tag to a word, the tag which is most likely in a given context. We can think of this process as mapping from words to tags. The most natural way to store mappings in Python uses the so-called dictionary data type (also known as an associative array or hash array in other programming languages). In this section we look at dictionaries and see how they can represent a variety of language information, including parts of speech."

Thus, if the bigram tagger would assign the same tag as its unigram backoff tagger in a certain context, the bigram tagger discards the training instance. This keeps the bigram tagger model as small as possible. We can further specify that a tagger needs to see more than one instance of a context in order to retain it, e.g. nltk.BigramTagger(sents, cutoff=2, backoff=t1) will discard contexts that have only been seen once or twice."

Thus, if our tagger encountered the word blog, not seen during training, it would assign it the same tag, regardless of whether this word appeared in the context the blog or to blog. How can we do better with these unknown words, or out-of-vocabulary items?\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful method to tag unknown words based on context is to limit the vocabulary of a tagger to the most frequent n words, and to replace every other word with a special word UNK using the method shown in 3. During training, a unigram tagger will probably learn that UNK is usually a noun. However, the n-gram taggers will detect contexts in which it has some other tag. For example, if the preceding word is to (tagged TO), then UNK will probably be tagged as a verb."
